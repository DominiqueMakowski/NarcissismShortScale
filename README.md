# Narcissism Short Scale

A reanalysis of the open-access data from [**Weidmann et al. (preprint)**](https://psyarxiv.com/5ygtc/), that contains a large sample of participants completing 8 popular narcissism scale.

We basically ran a massive factor analysis on all the individual 143 items together (see ***analysis.html***). We found that the optimal number of latent factors was 3 (below are the most loading items on each dimension), corresponding to **Demonstrative** (aka Contingent Self-Esteem, the demonstrative use for narcissism to mitigate low self-esteem issues), **Grandiose** (heightened sense of self-worth), and **Antagonistic** (disregard for others) narcissism.
